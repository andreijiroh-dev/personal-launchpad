This support guideline documents how do I triage issues in my public inbox here on GitHub/GitLab,
as well as through the public mailing list on sourcehut for external requests.

Note that this repository being both a personal issue tracker and public inbox on GitHub/GitLab,
hence the average time to resolve an issue is not a good indicator of the maintenance status of
this repository nor the percentage of issues still open.

## For sponsors

[See the dedicated documentation](./sponsors.md) for sponsors on how do I do priority SLAs for issues you filed.

## Search before filing an issue

It is highly recommended to search for existing issues (including other projects) before filing a
new one in the public inbox to avoid duplicates.

In GitHub, [there's a premade search query][query] to search for issues across all of my namespaces
which you can use to search for existing ones, although you can search by repo or by entire
namespace if needed.

If you found one, please comment and/or react (by upvoting/downvoting, etc.) on the existing issue
instead of filing a new one. On the existing issue, you can also subscribe to it to get notified of
any updates.

If you cannot find an existing issue that describes your bug or feature, submit an issue using the guidelines below.

## Filling and writing good issue

In GitHub, we utilize issue forms to help you file a issue easily and help me triage issues quickly,
with some TriageOps automation through GitHub Actions and custom webhook servers behind the scenes.

## Closing policy

* Issues that don't have the information requested above (when applicable) will be closed immediately and the poster directed to the support guidelines.
* Issues that gone stale (no activity in the last 14 days) will be closed in a week later through a scheduled job unless labelled with `stale-exempt` or has an activity. Note that closed issues may be locked at my discretion to prevent spam and off-topic comments.

# Public inbox for sponsors

This document describes how do I handle issues raised by sponsors, particularly with active
monthly sponsorships through GitHub Sponsors or other platforms such as Ko-fi and Patreon.

## Support SLA / Response Time

My current after-college hours is from 15:00 to 23:00 Philippine Standard Time (UTC+8) on
weekdays and 11:30 to 23:00 Philippine Standard Time (UTC+8) on weekends. On holidays, it is
either limited availability or out of office.

I aim to respond to all issues raised by sponsors within 24 hours in Philippine Standard Time,
subject to change caused by personal circumstances (i.e, burnout/mental health) or other
commitments. For the rest, I aim to respond within 48-72 hours, but this is not guaranteed.

## Is this pay-to-win?

No. Regular people can still contact me publicly in this issue tracker on GitHub or GitLab or
send me an email over at sourcehut, but sponsors will be prioritized for things like bug reports
and feature requests. This is not a pay-to-win scheme, but rather a way to ensure that sponsors
get the attention they deserve for supporting my work.

Note that the code of conduct still applies to all issues, including those raised by sponsors.
You will be blocked/muted if you are abusive or cause issues with anyone, regardless of
sponsorship status.

## Eligibility

If you are a sponsor through the following platforms, you will have priority in issues raised
on my open source projects, including the public inbox:

* GitHub Sponsors (either on [my profile](https://github.com/sponsors/ajhalili2006) or through Recap Time Squad or Community Lorebooks)
* HCB (either Recap Time Squad or Community Lorebooks)

### One-time or monthly?

For one-time supporters, a minimum of USD 15 is required to be eligible for priority response time for up to 30 days after the donation.

For monthly supporters, you will be eligible for priority response time as long as your sponsorship is active, though the minimum monthly amount is 5 USD (or 50 USD for yearly supporters).
